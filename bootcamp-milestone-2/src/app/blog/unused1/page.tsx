              <p>The second Hack4Impact meeting discussed things about Milestone 2 and new topics such as react.</p>
              <p>While I am not at Milestone 2 yet, it was nice to have an overview of those topics.</p>
              <p>I will be sure to keep everything we discussed in mind, and I'm sure it will help me when I get there!</p>
